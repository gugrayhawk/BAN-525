# BAN-525

This course was “Case Studies in Analytics”. In it we applied modern  predictive modeling methods to cases in business and economics. As we proceeded in the class, we would learn new modeling techniques add them to our toolbox to use in our class assignments. We used SAS JMP 15 as our analysis tool. For each assignment we were required to write a 4-5 page summary about our process. We would compare the results of all models and determine the champion. Each assignment consisted of a .jmp file consisting of data and model results and a .pdf document that outlined our process, analysis, and results. 

## “Oil Weekly.jmp” and “Assignment 1 Analysis.pdf”

Using 10 years of weekly prices for oil, exchange rates, commodities, and other financial investments, determine if there are predictable factors that can determine oil prices. Data analyzed using standard linear regression, including forward and backward stepwise regression. 

## “Silver Weekly.jmp” and “Assignment 2 Silver.pdf”

Using the same dataset as Assignment 1, determine what factors influence silver prices. We added penalized regression models, including Lasso, Elastic Net, and Ridge. 

## “Wine Quality BC.jmp” and “Assignment 3 wine.pdf”

We used Logistic Regression to determine if there are physiochemical determinants for the quality of wine. We could determine bad wines, but not good ones. The conclusion is that more hands-on analysis was needed. 

## “Sign of RGLD.jmp” and “Assignment 4.pdf”

Using the now familiar dataset from Assignment 1 and 2, develop a model that can predict the direction of Gold movement from week to week, and what those determinants are. In addition to using Logistic Regression, we added Random Forest analysis. 

## “Body Fat playing.jmp” and “Assignment 5 body fat.pdf” 

Determining body fat measurement through hydrostatic weighing is accurate but expensive. Can it be determined in an easier/cheaper way? We added Neural Networks to our bag of analysis tricks. 

## “Insurance.jmp” and “Assignment 6 Insurance.pdf”

How much should a health insurance company charge for insurance? How much information would they need to get from a prospective customer? We added more Neural Network modeling to this assignment. 

## “Equity2.jmp” and “BAN 525 final project equity loan.pdf”

Using logistic regression with all modeling techniques, discover the best model for determining if a home equity account is a good or bad risk. We also had to take into account missing data and see if we could glean any useful information from those rows.
